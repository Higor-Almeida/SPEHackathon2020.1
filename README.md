## Methodology
This is a Dash App which runs on Flask, hosted on PythonAnywhere and uses SQL as reference. <br>
Files inside are as description: <br>
1) **app.py:** <br>
   a) Processes a raw excel file and returns a valid dataframe which can be used for calculation, containing production values and removed typos. <br>
   b) Main function which takes user's inputs and returns the solution dataframe. The following logic applies to it: <br>
      b.1) User inputs what main information he wants: department, contract, operator, etc. All categories, no numbers. --> **Base Block**<br>
      b.2) User inputs specific base block information: which departments, which operators, which contracts, etc. --> **Special Block** <br>
      b.3) User inputs time specifics. Which year he wants, which trimester, which month, etc. --> **Time Block** <br>
2) **spyder.py:** <br>
   a) 
      
## Input format
The **solution(df,modes="")** method accepts two parameters: <br>
   1) **df** --> dataframe you're entering, this is standard on app.py, so not need to change it. <br>
   2) **modes** <br>
      Case 2.1) 'all' --> Selects all category columns.<br>
      Case 2.2.) All other category columns separated by a comma, **no blank spacen**, i.e.:<br>
         modes = 'Departamento,Municipio,Operadora' <br>
         The function takes a string separated by a comma and splits it.
